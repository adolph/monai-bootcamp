# Notes

Don't rebuild wheel, use and contribute to a set of best practices. Create an "AI Factory." Many common building blocks within all biomedical, such as image modalities which are different from non-biomed imaging but similar within biomed. 

Workflow: label, train, app dev, deployment

My interest: how to capture experts' inputs to improve models.

MONAI design goals: customizable, composable, domain specialized, HW optimized, reproducible

Using colab, GPU easy to get

Can pick and choose parts of MONAI are helpful. 

Look up NVIDIA GPU dashboards for researcher connection to what is running in container.
